# Welcome to My Blog

I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences in web development, technology, and software engineering. This blog is built with some fantastic modern technologies that I'd love to tell you about.

## Tech Stack

This blog is powered by:

- **Next.js 16** - The latest version with App Router
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX for interactive content
- **shadcn/ui** - Beautiful, accessible components
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first styling
- **TypeScript** - Type safety throughout

## What You Can Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Web development tutorials and tips
- React and Next.js best practices
- UI/UX design insights
- Career development in tech
- Project showcases and retrospectives

## Interactive Components

Since this blog uses MDX, I can embed React components directly in my posts. Pretty cool, right?

```typescript
// Example code block
function BlogPost({ title, content }: { title: string; content: string }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <div>{content}</div>
    </article>
  )
}
```

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
