# Building Modern UIs with shadcn/ui

When it comes to building modern React applications, choosing the right UI library can make or break your development experience. Today, I want to share why shadcn/ui has become my go-to choice for building interfaces.

## What Makes shadcn/ui Different

Unlike traditional component libraries that you install as a dependency, shadcn/ui takes a different approach:

- **Copy, don't install** - Components are copied into your codebase
- **Full customization** - You own the code, modify as needed
- **Radix primitives** - Built on accessible, unstyled primitives
- **Tailwind integration** - Seamless styling with utility classes

## Key Benefits

### 1. Accessibility First
All components are built on Radix UI primitives, which means:
- Screen reader support out of the box
- Proper keyboard navigation
- ARIA attributes handled automatically

### 2. Customization Freedom
Since you own the code:
- Modify behavior without fighting the library
- Add your own variants and styling
- No version lock-in concerns

### 3. Performance
- Only include components you actually use
- No large bundle sizes from unused components
- Tree-shaking works perfectly

## Example: Building a Card Component

Here's how easy it is to create a card component:

```tsx
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"

export function ProjectCard({ title, description, tags }) {
  return (
    <Card className="hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{title}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">{description}</p>
        <div className="flex gap-2 mt-4">
          {tags.map(tag => (
            <Badge key={tag} variant="secondary">{tag}</Badge>
          ))}
        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

## Getting Started

Setting up shadcn/ui in your Next.js project is straightforward:

1. Initialize the configuration
2. Add components as needed
3. Customize to your heart's content

The developer experience is fantastic, and the results speak for themselves.

## Conclusion

If you're building a React application and want beautiful, accessible components without the constraints of a traditional UI library, give shadcn/ui a try. You won't be disappointed!
